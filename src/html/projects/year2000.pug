        h1 Year 2000
        p A series of works that explore photographic image-making. This project was drawn from research in the tableaux vivant throughout art history and cinema. <i>Year 2000</i> is a group of carefully arranged landscapes that capture the banality of the recent past. The images gain a sense of heightened realism through color, subtle staging, and composition.
