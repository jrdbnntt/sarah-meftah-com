    h1 Year 2000
    p A series of works that explore photographic image-making. This project was drawn from research in the tableaux vivant throughout art history and cinema. #[i Year 2000] is a group of carefully arranged landscapes that capture the banality of the recent past. The images gain a sense of heightened realism through color, subtle staging, and composition.
